As an help for package providers, this version of HieroTeX tries to
conform to the TeX Directory Structure (DTS).

Everything under the "texmf" directory should move to one of your texmf directories.
(for instance under linux/debian, I would type 
     cp -R texmf /usr/share
     and follow by typing texhash).

The rest of the files :

* hierotex uses a pre-processor called "sesh", which is a C
  program. The sources are included and should compile fine. I also
  include a version of the executable program as a courtesy for m/s
  windows users, as the later, unlike real operating systems, doesn't
  include a C compiler.
